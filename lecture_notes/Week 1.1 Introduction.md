# Week 1.1 Introduction
## What is Machine Learning?
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
+ Example (email program):
	+ Task T: classifying emails as spam or not spam
	+ Experience E: watching you label emails as spam or not spam
	+ Performance P: the number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam
## Supervised Learning
+ "right answers" are given
+ **Regression:** Predict continuous valued output
+ **Classification:** Discrete valued output
+ Example:
	+ Predict how may of items will sell over the next 3 months ==> regression
	+ Decide if has been hacked/compromised for each customer account ==> classification
## Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
+ There is no feedback based on the prediction results
+ Cocktail party problem
+ Language: **Octave**
