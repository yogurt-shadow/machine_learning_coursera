# Week 4.1 Neural Networks - Representation (Non-linear Hypotheses)
## Motivations
+ example: nonlinear hypothesis explodes

## Neural Networks
+ A single neuron (as a logistic unit)

+ Neural Network

+ symbols:
	+ $a_i^{(j)}:$ "activation" of unit i in layer j
	+ $\Theta^{j}$: matrix of weights controlling from layer j to layer j+1
+ forward propagation

+ learning its own features using hidden layer
